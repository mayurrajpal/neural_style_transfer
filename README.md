# neural_style_transfer

Neural style transfer is a fascinating technique in the field of deep learning that involves merging two distinct images: a content image and a style reference image, such as a piece of art by a renowned painter. The resulting image retains the essential elements of the content image but is rendered in the artistic style of the reference image. This process allows for the creation of visually stunning artworks and has been incorporated into several popular apps like Prisma, DreamScope, and PicsArt. These applications utilize neural style transfer to enable users to transform their photos into unique pieces of digital art, combining the familiarity of their original images with the creativity of various artistic styles.

Neural style transfer leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve this effect by extracting and recombining the content and style features from the respective images. This technique has not only found applications in art and photography but also in design and advertising, where it aids in creating visually compelling content.

# Running the files

- Just open the nst.ipynb file.
- You can also modify the values of the parameters and see the changes in your results.
- To pass the paths of the input the imagees, you need to just paste the path of the content and style images in the variables path_style and path_content from your drive.
